<p class="indentm">bout a year ago, having collected all those
poems and verses which I considered of any
value, I took a certain pride in the thought
that I might soon bring under one roof these
imaginary children of mine, so that they might be sheltered
in time of storm, as it were, from the cold, and
oftimes unfeeling world of commerce but where friends
of poetry, who had met with some of my stray children
of verse in public journals, might meet with them
again, if they desired, with other friendly faces around
one common fireside.</p>

<p>But I found that the expense incident to such a venture
was so great that unless a large number of copies
were sold I would be involved in a larger debt than I
cared to contract. Then the plan of securing sufficient
advance subscriptions to meet part of the expense of a
first edition occurred to me, thereby following the
method of Tennyson, Robert Burns and others, of
whose example I needed not to be ashamed, but other
work prevented me, and still prevents me, from carrying
out this plan.</p>

<p>So lest those friends who have shown an interest in
my verses should think that I have turned aside from
the Path of Poetry, I herewith offer "The Calendar and
Other Verses," as evidence of my love for and interest
in the greatest of all the arts, hoping that the time may
come when I shall be able to present a more worthy
offering to the Muses and perhaps justify the kind words
that have recently appeared in regards to the author
of "The Quiet Life"&mdash;A Plain Poem of the Hills, which,
in a revised form, appeared serially during the past
summer in The Wayne Countean.</p>

<span class="im">ome walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis January;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The knee-deep snow lies heavy on the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hark!&mdash;the icy winds&mdash;how swift they hurry<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over the fields with melancholy sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And save these winds or some forsaken raven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Winging its way along yon frozen hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature is hush'd&mdash;her dormant image graven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In marble masks on woodland, lake and rill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And look!&mdash;the trees their naked trunks are swaying,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As bitterly each blast goes howling by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hark!&mdash;the music in the hemlocks playing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like some lost spirit banished from the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see the smoke from yonder chimney curling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hugs the broad roofs, deep-burden'd with the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While clouds of snow are round the low eaves whirling.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How cold it is!&mdash;Come, let us homeward go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There will we find the cheerful fire still burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There ruddy warmth will make our faces glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there kind hearts will welcome our returning;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come!&mdash;let us hasten through the drifty snow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis February;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sun is creeping slowly toward the North,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And every breeze to-day seems blithe and merry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And prophets of the Spring are waking forth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hungry ground-hog casts a thin, gray shadow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beside his open villa, dark and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the starv'd hare surveys the icy meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And chipmonks chatter in the leafless wold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hark!&mdash;the blue-jay's fife is sounding shrilly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And merry chickadees are piping loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en though the bitter North-wind's breath is chilly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the great trees are low before him bow'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see!&mdash;the Lady of the South is creeping<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Higher and higher&mdash;'Tis the hour of noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sad-eyed Winter by yon brook is weeping,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yon little brook that sings a pleasant tune.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, as the sun is with the day declining,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Swift, darkening clouds are gathering in the West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the snow-fairies are again designing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another robe for Nature's barren breast.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MARCH.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis March and windy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Winter's dying breath comes hard and fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hark!&mdash;the storm, like death-bells of a Sunday,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tolls the sad knell upon the icy blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder and louder now the winds are wailing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Faster and faster wings the frozen snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darker and darker the cold clouds are sailing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the March-storm goes hurrying to and fro.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But see!&mdash;the sun above the clouds is creeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And look!&mdash;soft flakes are falling, one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Winter, pale in death, lies gently sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While Spring awakes e'er half the day is done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon the sun, like some great hearth is burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Melting the ghosts of Winter on the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hark!&mdash;the robin from the South returning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Joins the glad music of the murmuring rills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the farmer-boy, whose heart is leaping,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Gathers the sap that sings a merry song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the blue-birds sweet melodies are keeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And noisy squirrels leap the trees among.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>APRIL.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis April weather;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A voice like Spring is calling: Let us go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where violets are blooming on the heather,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And song-birds bend the branches to and fro;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For everywhere the very ground is springing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And everywhere the grass is getting green&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can I now&mdash;how can I keep from singing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When all the world is like a fairy scene!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The buds in all the trees, are ripe for bursting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fleecy catkins flutter everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every little flower seems a-thirsting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For something sweet and beautiful and fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But look!&mdash;to Westward&mdash;see!&mdash;an April shower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sudden has gathered, darkening the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet wait!&mdash;beside me lifts a gentle flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That lights my pathway, blossoming alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hark!&mdash;O hark, the meadow-lark is singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Greeting the storm from yon tall maple tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, like a herald in its homeward winging,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wheels a lone flicker o'er the darkening lea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MAY</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis merry May-time;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The little lambs are gamboling on the green,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature is glad&mdash;it is her hour of playtime,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now, or never, her true heart is seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butterflies are floating down from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And humming-birds again are on the wing,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the kind swallows, seventy times seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fill all the air with merry murmuring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And see the lilacs by yon cottage blooming!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How sweet the air is!&mdash;sweetness everywhere,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For look!&mdash;rich apple-blossoms are perfuming<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This little lane that leads to woodlands fair,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here honeysuckle-bells are softly swinging,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pink azaleas perfume all the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in the trees, the vireos are singing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Incessantly their songs of solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While round the hill, as slow our steps are wending,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We hear a sweet Voice calling,&mdash;"Come, O come!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For see!&mdash;the sun is in the West decending,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And happy hearts are waiting us at home.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>JUNE</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis June,&mdash;fair June-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Nature smiles&mdash;her magic hands are still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not a ripple stirs yon lake at noon-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And not a breeze disturbs this woody hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hark!&mdash;what idle dreamer there is drumming?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It is&mdash;it is a pheasant calling&mdash;"Come!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listen!&mdash;like a low voice sweetly humming<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is heard the brook within its forest home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But wait!&mdash;We cannot wait&mdash;'Twill soon be Summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So let us now enjoy these days of June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hear ye not that late, but welcome comer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Robert-of-Lincoln carroling his tune;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see ye not yon oriole high swinging<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His basket from that tall and leafy tree&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Comrade, Comrade!&mdash;Time is swiftly winging,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twill not be always June with you and me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spring-time is passing&mdash;Summer is a-coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And soon fair Autumn with her idle dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then cold Winter, her White hands benumbing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The icy lakes and silent, woodland streams!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Comrade!&mdash;Comrade!&mdash;let us not be weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But pick life's pretty blossoms while they bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting every prospect, sad or dreary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Avoiding every lane that leads to gloom!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For see!&mdash;each flower lifts a golden chalice<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Inviting us to drink&mdash;Shall we pass by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faces sad, nor enter this fair palace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That June has rear'd us 'neath a cloudless sky?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h3>PART TWO.</h3>

<h4>JULY.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis July weather;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The western sun is burning round and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a breeze disturbs yon tiny feather<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From a young swallow loosen'd in its flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hark!&mdash;in yonder broad and sunlit meadow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sound of busy mowers fill the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from a tree that casts a pleasing shadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is heard the locust piping shrilly there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And see, how strong men lift the scented grasses!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And how they pile the wagons with the hay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fast the rake, with rolling burden, passes!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How regular the long, round winrows lay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see!&mdash;the sun&mdash;the great round sun is setting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a red rose upon the distant hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all the earth seems tenderly forgetting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Day's dying light on meadow, lake and rill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But come!&mdash;for darkness soon will gather round us,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we must pass through yonder woodlands there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then white fields of buckwheat will surround us,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then&mdash;then&mdash;home we shall together share.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>AUGUST</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis August. Listen!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The meadow-quail is whistling merrily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see!&mdash;the dew-drops, like great diamonds, glisten<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On grass and shrub and bush and bending tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everywhere is peace and joy and plenty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For everywhere this morning we may go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One seed of Spring has well returned its twenty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till Autumn's face with goodness is aglow.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, oaten fields are white and ripe for reaping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And green things paling in the garden there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell us too well that Summer is a-sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And harvest-time is on us unaware;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The early apples even now are falling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tassel'd corn, the fields of ripening rye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purpling grape&mdash;all, all are sadly calling<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That Summer's glory, too, must fade and die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hark!&mdash;what sound is that!&mdash;it seems like thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet 'tis but the wind, within the trees,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The far-off wind, fresh-filled with nameless wonder,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A prophesy of Autumn's freshening breeze.<br /></span>

<h4>SEPTEMBER</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis sweet September;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And quietly the clouds are gliding by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silent runs the brook that, you remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We pass'd last Spring&mdash;it now is dumb and dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And overhead, the first red leaf is falling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, underfoot, the flowers are fading fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While in the air I hear a strange, sad calling<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That tells me Summer is forever past.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And yet how peaceful seems the face of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How calm the earth is&mdash;Nature is at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the hopes that unto Spring were given,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Folds Autumn now in silence to her breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds are singing, yet not half so sweetly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As when they sung their song at opening Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flowers are blooming, yet not so completely<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As when the birds were first upon the wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am singing&mdash;but the fading glory<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Autumn-time subdues my idle song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what is Autumn but the sweet sad story<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of leaves that fade and lives that last not long.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Come walk a mile with me&mdash;'Tis now October;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet the fields put forth fresh blades of green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the advancing days shall seem to sober,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And prophesy too plainly the unseen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Nature loves to lead us forward blindly,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Giving a glory to the fading leaf!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet were it worse if, speaking less unkindly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nature should plainly tell us life is brief.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The flowers, too, are fading&mdash;and are dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The leaves are falling, and incessantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the hills great flocks of crows are crying,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the blue-jays once more are calling me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Winter!&mdash;Winter soon, too soon, is coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For see!&mdash;see there,&mdash;the frost is on the grass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild-bee&mdash;I hear no more its humming<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As once I did, wherever I might pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And robin&mdash;he is gone, and all the singing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of all the sweet birds now no more I hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the dry leaves, to barren branches clinging,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Full plainly speak the passing of the year.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Like some good martyr e'er he goes to die;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And silent is each bare and leafless form;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brooks&mdash;how quiet!&mdash;I like not their flowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For oh,&mdash;it is the calm before the storm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, yes&mdash;e'en now&mdash;to Westward&mdash;look! a figure<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is sudden forming, stretching forth a wand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaping a shape as of some giant, bigger<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than any fabled thing from Fairyland;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Higher and higher that strange shape is lifting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Swifter and swifter its fleet heralds run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wider and wider its white breath is drifting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As lower sinks the slow decending sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now&mdash;the storm!&mdash;the storm is on us. Hurry!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet see!&mdash;the myriad snow-flakes&mdash;see them come!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Comrade!&mdash;See!&mdash;it is young Winter's flurry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet 'tis but the storm that drives us home.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">'Tis noon, and lo!&mdash;yon glorious orb of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is turning backward, a New-year designing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So shall all Winters turn to Spring alway.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so shall Winter be an emblem only<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the dark days that meet us, one and all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making our little lives seem sad and lonely,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until the New-Year answers to our call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until another Spring renewing Nature;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Renews our hopes that were so desolate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giving us faith that not one living creature<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is blindly born to blindly meet its fate.<br /></span>
